# Horiseon

## The Horiseon Marketing Agency needed help with their accesibility standards throughout their webpage, along with slight changes to their styling as well. All images have been
provided appropriate "alt" attributes, and each section has been clearly identified, labelled, and set up in sequential order. The stylesheet had to be altered to accomdoate
the look they were going for, and was also provided clear identifications, labels, and set up in sequential order. 

All links on the nav bar are functional, all font and headers have been given proper sizing and spacing. All images have bene given proper sizing and spacing, and links on html 
were corrected the refer to show correct image in correlating section. 

...The End?
